# solo-scan
SoloScan is used for creating 3D point clouds of objects.

1. Backgroound should remain constant
2. Images must have 30-40% correlation.
3. Outliers should be removed accordingly.
To use this code,
1. Run window.py file
2. Graphical user interface opens where you have to click "Create 3D point cloud"
3. Window1.py will run automatically
It takes 45 minutes to create an accurate 3D point cloud.
Accuracy is 70-80%.
