# solo-scan
SoloScan is used for creating 3D point clouds of objects.
Thing to consider when using this code:
1. Backgroound should remain constant
2. Images must have 30-40% correlation.
3. Outliers should be removed accordingly.
To use this code,
1. Run SIFT.py file
2. Graphical user interface opens where you have to click "Create 3D point cloud"
It takes 45 minutes to create an accurate 3D point cloud.
Accuracy is 70-80%.
